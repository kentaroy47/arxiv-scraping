# arxiv-scraping
let's scrape arxiv papers by python



## usage

python arxiv_scrape.py



## plot and analyze.

most arxiv papers have citations == 0.

This is kind of sad.

![hist](./histgram_of_citations.png)

Out of 6000 acquired papers, almost half of them have 0 citations.



80% of the papers have less than 10 citations (so don't be depressed if you don't get any citations! I guess it's pretty normal.)
